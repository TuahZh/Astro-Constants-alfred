In the scripts of workflow, you can edit the ScriptsFilter with key word "con".
Change the PythonPath to the path where your python is.
You can use "which python" to see your default python path. Please make sure that the astropy has been installed in this python.

2. You can use this workflow by typing "con"+some related words of what you want to look up.
e.g. "con G"
